## Agile
* Agile manifesto created in 2001
	* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
	* Working software over comprehensive documentation
	* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
	* Responding to change over following a plan


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/bg.jpg" class="agile" -->
## Agile
* What it means
	* Iterative and incremental
	* Short, regular meetings
	* Feedback loop
* Loose methodology
	* Lots of different interpretations


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/bg.jpg" class="agile" -->
## Agile: Sprints
* Short development cycles
	* Usually between one week and one month
	* Includes planning, design, development and testing
	* Delivers a working product at the end
	* Product can be demonstrated to stakeholders


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/bg.jpg" class="agile" -->
## Agile: Scrum

</ul>

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/bg.jpg" class="agile" -->
### Agile: Scrum meetings
* No more than 15 minutes
* Also called standups (if you stand you don't take too long)
* Three questions
	* What did I complete yesterday
	* What will I do today
	* What roadblocks may prevent progress
* Problems are recorded by the Scrum Master to raise later
* No detailed discussion during scrum meeting


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/bg.jpg" class="agile" -->
### Agile: Sprint Review & Retrospective
* Sprint Review
	* Meet with stakeholders
	* Review work completed and not completed
	* Present demo
	* Decide what to do next

* Sprint Retrospective
	* Used for continious improvement
	* What went well in the sprint
	* What can be improved

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/bg.jpg" class="agile" -->
## Agile: User Stories
* One sentance statement describing user need
* As a \_ I want to \_ so that \_
* Always written from the user's perspective


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/bg.jpg" class="agile" -->
## Agile: To summarise

* Very few places fully implement an agile methodology
* I personally use a mix of Kanban and Scrum at the moment



<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/bg.jpg" class="lean" -->
## LeanUX
* Builds on
	* iterative processes from Agile
	* user focus from user centred design


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/bg.jpg" class="lean" -->
## LeanUX

<ul style="flex-grow: 1">
	<li>Short iterative development cycles</li>
	<li>Regular user feedback</li>
</ul>
</div>

Note:
Instead of focusing on particular functionality, each cycle starts with a problem or hypothesis. A small product or prototype is developed, tested and finally reviewed before the process starts again.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/bg.jpg" class="lean" -->
## LeanUX: Hypothesis
* Start with a problem statement - not a feature
* What are the assumptions in this problem statement?
* Build to test those assumptions

## Minimum Viable Product

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/bg.jpg" class="lean" -->
## Minimum Viable Product
* The goal is to test on users
* The feature needs to feel ready for users
* Does not have to be release ready

## The Marshmallow Challenge

## The Marshmallow Challenge
* In groups of 4 can you complete the marshmallow challenge

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/bg.jpg" class="experiences" -->
## Experiences: Digital Musrembang
* SMS System to improve communication with local government
* Selected SMS as internet access is limited
* Mountainous region with limited mobile signal

* Didn't understand context of use
* Already committed to solution when problems were identified


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/bg.jpg" class="experiences" -->
## Experiences: Tracking small fishing boats
* GPS trackers and tablets to record fishing catches
* Spent a lot of time of time focusing on what happens at sea
	* Waterproof, offline synchronisation, unreliable power
* Didn't think about what happens on land
	* Tablets broken by children and poor storage


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/bg.jpg" class="experiences" -->
## Experiences: Online Course
* Year long project with no clear client
* Made lots of great looking tools
* After release a US university asked if it was accessible enouch to use in their course
	* We had to say it was not


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/bg.jpg" class="experiences" -->
## Experience: Augmented Reality Worksheets
* Asked to develop AR tools to visualise physics classes
* User testing found AR was difficult to use and added no value
* Developed interactive 3D worksheets instead
